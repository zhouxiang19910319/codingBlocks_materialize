**3 years strong** 07/15/2020 DONE

I have been a weekly listener for 3 years now. The content of this pod has remained excellent and relevant throughout that time. The honest discussions are great and have had direct impact in some cases to my daily work! Thanks for all the hard work! Keep up the advertisement voice outlaw! üçª

Is as good as the first review. Amazing show, perfect for when you aren‚Äôt at your IDE or editor and want to stay in the loop and learn new concepts and practices to tackle the daily challenges of programming life. It‚Äôs funny, informative, and you never feel like you haven‚Äôt gained something. This show will add value to your career, so listen! In addition underwood, outlaw, and joe all still actively do presentations and side projects, unlike other podcasts where the hosts can‚Äôt deal with children, work, and side pursuits. It shows a level of commitment and passion that‚Äôs pretty rare to find. I love it, good job boys, come visit colorado some time!!!

Great show! As someone just starting to learn programming, some of the content is a bit over my head, but I always get something useful out of each episode. And many of the episodes are very beginner friendly. Listening to the podcast is like having three great (virtual) programming mentors. Highly recommended!

**Fantastic**
I listen about 10 hours a week of podcasts and this is one of my favorites. I‚Äôm a second degree in CS student and really appreciate the work and detail they put into the show. I especially recommend the data structures episodes.

I‚Äôm still working my way through older episodes and haven‚Äôt come across specific episodes on google SRE, but listening to the Google code reviews have me wondering if it would be a good one for them to tackle.

Regardless of what‚Äôs next, Here‚Äôs hoping for many more great episodes! (and songs!)

**Super Helpful**
Recently, I stumbled upon Robert C. Martin‚Äôs clean code talks on YouTube. Then I went searching for a podcast that discussed his ideas, and found Coding Blocks. Listening to the guy‚Äôs discussions has helped me to clarify Martin‚Äôs ideas and understand concrete applications. However, the real boon to discovering this podcast is being introduced to other interesting resources and joining in on the conversation about them.

**Good and relevant conversation**  DONE
As a novice developer, I am learning quite a bit. If I don't understand the subject, they discuss it in such ann easy manner, it somehow helps me to tuck the conversation away in my head for easy recall when I later encounter these concepts in my learning. I then go back to the podcast where I remember they spoke of it and drop in their conversation again. It is nice to hear industry developers flesh out concepts beyond just an academic or instructional viewpoint and place the subject matter in everyday contexts that an industry developer would encounter. Even though they are experienced developers, they seem to be genuinely interested in the subjects they discuss as if they were new to the industry and this is very encouraging for me.
